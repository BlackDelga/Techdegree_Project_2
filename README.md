# Techdegree_Project_2
In this project, I use a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

Starting with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. Them write JavaScript to display 10 names at a time, and add a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time. and Them add a search button to search a Student throw the list, if a Student is not listed a messanger will display.
